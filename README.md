## Setup Steps:
1. Clone repoistory to a folder with `GOPATH` set

### Back-End Server:
1. Go to BEServer folder and run the back-end server using: `go run BEsrv.go`
2. To run the back-end server, we need GRPC set up on the machine
3. Ensure the following grpc libraries are present at the path `GOPATH/src/` :
    * "golang.org/x/net/context"
    * "google.golang.org/grpc"
    * "google.golang.org/grpc/reflection"
4. The above libraries can be obtained as shown here: https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html


### Front-End Server:
1. The following files need to be built to run: `Data.go and srv.go`
2. Have the back-end server running before the front-end server starts
3. Go to - http://localhost:9090/home If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login page.
